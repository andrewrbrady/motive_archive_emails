### Just as any museum has a curatorial team to photograph, document, archive and catalogue the works they have–it is vital for the modern collector to do the same.

We understand that your classic cars are more than just vehicles; they're pieces of history, works of art, and treasured investments. That's why we've dedicated ourselves to preserving and enhancing the value of your automotive collection. From stunning photography and videography to meticulous detailing, expert inspections, and comprehensive documentation, Motive Archive offers a suite of services designed to elevate your prized possessions. Best of all, we provide all these services under one roof at our state-of-the-art facility, ensuring seamless, integrated care for your automotive treasures.

## MOTIVE ON THE MARKET

![Alt text](https://imagedelivery.net/veo1agD2ekS5yYAVWyZXBA/7eb7d462-b20d-4305-8a66-2d2f94aa1600/public)

We recently curated a Bring a Trailer listing which showcased the enduring appeal of classic Porsches, even in a softening market (and a lively comment section, to boot). A 1953 Porsche 356 Pre-A bent-window coupe managed to fetch a price above the current market average, demonstrating that exceptional presentation still commands a premium value. Bidders took notice of the curated presentation and meticulous documentation highlighting the car's true condition and history. This sale underscores a crucial point for collectors: in any market condition, proper documentation and accurate presentation can significantly influence a classic car's value and desirability.

**Brad, what's your role at Motive Archive?**

I lead the detailing team here. We're all about making sure these incredible collector cars look their absolute best, preserving their beauty and history.

**What have been some career highlights for you?**

There have been a few unforgettable moments. Driving the yellow Countach across the stage at Pebble Beach was pretty surreal. We also had a McLaren F1 LM win best in class at The Quail, which was amazing to be a part of.

**Any notable projects you've worked on?**

We were lucky enough to be the official detailers for the F1 owners tour in the US. Getting up close with so many legendary cars and their passionate owners was really special.

**What do you think sets your team apart in the detailing world?**

I'd say it's our experience and passion for these cars. We've been fortunate to work on quite a few Concours-level cars for events like Pebble Beach and The Quail. It's always a learning experience, and we love the challenge of bringing out the best in each unique vehicle.
