### This 1964 Jaguar D-Type Long-Nose Recreation, masterfully crafted by Wingfield, embodies the spirit of the iconic Le Mans champion.

One of only three alloy-bodied examples built by the esteemed Williams and Pritchard coachbuilders, it stands out in classic Ecurie Ecosse Blue. At its heart lies a Ron Beatty-built 4.2-liter engine, delivering 285 horsepower through a synchronized 4-speed gearbox. Triple Weber carburetors, 4-wheel disc brakes, and 16" Dunlop wheels faithfully recreate the D-Type's legendary performance. This exceptional vehicle, featured in Graham Robson's definitive Jaguar D-Type book and on the cover of Jaguar Gazette, retains its original patina - a testament to its authenticity. For the discerning collector, this Jaguar offers a rare opportunity to own a piece of motorsport history reimagined.

### Interested parties are invited to contact Motive Archive for more information.

### _We sat down with Adam Kosela, who leads the detailing team at Motive Archive._

**Adam, can you tell us about your background in automotive service?**

I've been working with cars for most of my life. I started young and was fortunate to become one of the youngest Audi R8 technicians. That experience laid the foundation for my career in luxury and performance vehicles.

**How does your experience with Euroquipe inform your work at Motive Archive?**

Euroquipe has given me extensive hands-on experience with a wide range of European marques. This broad knowledge is invaluable when inspecting and servicing collector cars at Motive. Each vehicle, whether it's a classic Porsche or a modern Ferrari, has its own quirks and needs.

**What's unique about Motive's approach to service and inspection?**

At Motive, we understand that these aren't just cars—they're pieces of history. We're not just fixing issues; we're preserving automotive heritage.

**What's one piece of advice you'd give to collectors about maintaining their vehicles?**

Regular, careful maintenance is key. Even if a car isn't driven often, it needs attention. Fluids degrade, seals can dry out. A proactive approach helps preserve the car's condition and value.

**What's the most rewarding part of your role at Motive Archive?**

It's the opportunity to work on some of the world's most exceptional cars. Each vehicle that comes through our doors has a story, and being part of preserving that history is truly special.
